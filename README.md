# Personal-Project-1---Console-Calculator

## Description

This is the first real project I have ever made, which took me around 20 hours to get it done.
I have fully removed lines that were only used for debbuging before submitting this project.

## What does it do?
The calculator FULLY supports PEMDAS:
-It checks for order of priority after every operation
-It checks if there are parentheses inside larger ones, and performs calculations in the inner parentheses first
-It supports long equations as long as they use any of the following operators: 
( ) ^ * / + -

## What does it not do?

-It does NOT support fractions 
-It does NOT support unknown variables (x,y..)
-No remainder division implementation
-No square root implementation

## How to use?
1) Clone the repository
2) Open the project in your IDE of choice (Visual Studio recommended)
3) Compile and run the program
4) Enter any mathematical expression using the following operators: ( ) ^ * / + -
5) Press ENTER when the equation is ready to be processed
